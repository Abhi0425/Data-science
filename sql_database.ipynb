    "SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are table-based and follow a predefined schema, making them great for complex queries and transactions. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",

    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and provide a more flexible data model. They are suitable for large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they don't require a fixed schema. NoSQL databases can be categorized into document-oriented, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. "
